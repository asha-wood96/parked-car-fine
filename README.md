Parked Car Ticket Generator 

This program in its most basic form calculates a parking ticket for a parked car who has parked for more minutes than the number of minutes they originally paid at the parking meter. A police patrol reports to the scene and displays information about the car and then show the fine breakdown of how much money it ends up costing.


The users can simply run the program by clicking build and run.

This program does not ask/take input from the user in the terminal/output window.

Instead the user most manually type in information for the program to use located in the main function 

For this reason there is already example info in those slots but the user can change it as much and/or as many times as they like

note: if the user tries the rand() type to replace numbers with random generated it doesn't usually show a clear depiction of the fine because the numbers for minutes parked or purchased turns out being really big or really small)

The info the the user can put in is note: in each one of these there is three of each type so the program can compare

1. the parked car's info which is make, model, color, license plate number, and MINUTES PARKED (obviously the most important bacause that is the main point of the program this one can be manipulated a lot)
2. police officer and badge number (this doesn't do much just displays the same thing on the screen)
3. MINUTES PAID AT THE PARKING METER (i.e. use of all caps is for importance) to use in calculation

in the output if the minutes parked didn't go over minutes purchased it will just say that there is no parking violation for the car

also it is shown in the program that a base fine is $25 for the first hour or part of an hour car is illegally parked 
but not shown is that the fine is $10 for each additional hour or part of an hour a car is aprked illegally. 
It also prints out hourly fine which is then added to create the total fine

This program is a general template I followed in the section programming challenge "Parking Ticket Simulator" of chapter 14 in the textbook "starting out with c++ from control structures through objects" (8th ed.)

Copy and paste the program in an IDE to run the program and see results
